    <div class="about">
      <p>
        Oscar Broughton has recently submitted his Ph.D. thesis entitled, Guilds at Home and Abroad: A History of Knowledge of Guild Socialism, at the Graduate School for Global Intellectual History at Humboldt Universität and the Freie Universität Berlin. He holds an MA in Global History from Humboldt Universität and the Freie Universität Berlin and a BA in Intellectual History from the University of Sussex.
      </p>
      <p>
        He specialises in Modern Intellectual and Social History, Global History, Environmental History,  Food History, and the History of Knowledge. He has regional interests in Europe and Latin America, especially, Britain, Brazil, and Germany. 
      </p>
      <p>
        His research interests include industrial democracy, commodity circulation, anarchism, nationalism, libertarian socialism, the works of William Morris, Gustav Landauer, A.D. Gordon, G.D.H. Cole, and the development of welfare and organised labour programs, such as Bolsa Família, Betriebsräte, and the National Health Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        His Ph.D. thesis explores the rise and significance of Guild Socialism which first emerged in Britain during the early 20th century and became popular internationally during the Interwar Period, especially in Austria, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States. This form of socialism was defined from other models, such as parliamentary socialism and revolutionary vanguardism, and proposed the transformation of existing trade union structures into a series of new institutions known as National Guilds, which would control all aspects of production in a society. The development of Guild Socialism was centrally organised around the National Guilds League (1915-23) which was composed of a mixture of men and women from working-class and middle-class backgrounds that included trade unionists, socialist intellectuals, and political activists. Collectively these individuals drew together various forms of practical and theoretical knowledge which became integral to the different meanings of Guild Socialism.

        <p class="phd">
          His research project examines guild socialism a rare and striking example of a radical political idea, which grasped the intellects and imaginations of theorists predominantly within the anglophone world during the twentieth century.
          Developing initially in Britain around a group of mostly British intellectuals, the movement began as an anti-statist response to the state socialist policies of the Fabian Society. While the development of guild socialism as both an
          ideology and an intellectual movement started in Britain its influence and linkages beyond this setting are numerous, and have been seldom commented upon and never understood collectively by historians. These connections include ties to
          Austria, specifically to Karl Polanyi and the Austro-marxists Otto Bauer and Rudolf Hilferding; Australia where guild socialism influenced local socialists, nationalists and labour organisations, particularly in Melbourne; and in the US
          where multitudes of socialist observers such as Ordway Tead, Harry W. Laidler, William English Walling and the International Workers of the World, keenly discussed guild socialism in relation to the question of industrial democracy.
        </p>
        <p class="phd">
          This project investigates the growth and decline of the guild socialism between 1900 and 1926. It seeks to go beyond the methodological nationalism, which has defined previous historical work on this topic by examining the global
          entanglements between intellectuals and ideologies that fostered guild socialism. Furthermore it also aims to highlight the panoramic world view of the guild socialists themselves, who sought various optics in their search for a socialist
          future and were ultimately mediated by their experiences of nation-states and empire.
